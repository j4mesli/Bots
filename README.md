Automated bots I've created using Python for various purposes.

<a href="https://twitter.com/snoreuto">**@snoreuto**</a> is a twitter bot I created using Python's TweePy module to automatically post a tweet whenever a new episode of *BORUTO: NARUTO NEXT GENERATIONS* airs on Crunchyroll. The bot has a counter that increments when the new episode is not manga-canon (filler or anime-canon), and resets the counter if the episode is manga-canon. I hosted this script on PythonAnywhere.com's servers and created a cron job to automatically run it once a week. As of this update, it has been exactly one year since the last manga canon *BORUTO: NARUTO NEXT GENERATIONS* episode.
